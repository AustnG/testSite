            The Tau, or T'au, are a race of blue-skinned aliens inhabiting a small but growing empire located on the
            fringes of the Imperium of Man. The Tau Empire is the only faction in the setting that actively integrates
            alien species into their society. They seek to subjugate all other races for the benefit of all, under an
            ideology they call "the Greater Good." Some human worlds have willingly defected from the Imperium to the
            Tau Empire. Although humans are effectively second-class citizens in Tau society, they still tend to have a
            better quality of life than Imperium citizens. Despite overall better living conditions, T'au life is
            typically heavily regimented and citizens experience little or no freedom.<br />
            <br />
            Tau armies have a strong preference for ranged combat. The Tau do not have any psykers nor units that
            specialise in countering psykers, which makes them somewhat more vulnerable to psychic attacks. Most Tau
            vehicles are classified as flyers, skimmers, or jet pack infantry, meaning they can move swiftly over
            difficult terrain.<br />
