            You'll want to start by aiming for 2hq's and 3 troops, which will build you a battalion list. If you can
            find it there's a starting box that comes with 1 commanders and 1 ethereal on a drone, I'd suggest starting
            with that.<br />
            <br />
            Get them built and painted then buy 2 Fire Warrior boxes and at that point you should be good to go, post
            codex that should be about 350-400 points depending on how many troops you use, that gives you room for
            something fun you like and want to bring that's about 150 point, I suggest a stealth team or path finder
            team, but get whatever you want. Aim for 500 point skirmish list to start.<br />

            https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Start-Collecting-Tau-Empire-2017<br />
            -Ethereal on Hover Drone<br />
            -3x XV8 Crisis Battlesuits<br />
            -10x Fire Warriors team (including 2x drones and a DS8 Support Turret)<br />
            <br />
            -------------------------------------------<br />
            Suggested starting models<br />
            <br />
            -Start Collecting (1x or 2x) (for the fire warriors and crisis suits)<br />
            -Commander<br />
            -Pathfinders<br />
            -RIPTIDE<br />
            <br />
            -Cadre Fireblade<br />
            -Something heavier: Broadsides, Ghostkeel, Hammerhead, Riptide, Stormsurge depending on aesthetics, budget,
            and competitiveness<br />
            <br />
            To answer the questions:<br />
            <br />
            Get a riptide first. for $85 you get a 280 point model if optimized that's one of the best units in the
            game, and would be your big anti tank weapon. If you're fighting primaris the Heavy Burst Cannon with ATS is
            S6 -2AP with 2 Damage, so it'll mulch them fine. Use some extra drone bits from your Start Collecting to
            make the extra drones shield drones.<br />
            <br />
            Crisis suits aren't good right now because they cost too much. They're still fun and can be good in the
            future. Magnetize those weapons for future changes.<br />
            <br />
            I wouldn't get a second box. You have an Etheral and Suit team already, so a box of fire warriors is a good
            choice.<br />
            <br />
            The main objective is to get a Battalion, and then get the Tau essentials, so the order of business is 1.
            Fire Warriors, 2. Cadre Fireblade or a Coldstar Commander 3. Pathfinders 4. Riptide. After that you can
            start specializing what units you really want to use, either Hammerheads, Broadsides, more riptides or lots
            of fire warriors.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            ---Stealth Suits recommended<br />
            ---Kroot also recommended<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br /><br /><br />
            Whole units to avoid: not a lot. Piranhas are kind of weak. Kroot Shapers and Krootox Riders suck. The
            Tidewall Shieldline and Tidewall Gunrig are pretty poor.<br />
            <br />
            Crisis suits aren't bad per se, but they're pretty expensive, need support, and are a bit of a glass cannon
            unit. They also only really have three viable loadouts, flamers, cyclic ion, and fusion blasters (last one
            is insane overkill against most armies). Also get out competed by Commanders quite heavily.<br />
            <br />
            Tau have tons of different guns, and not surprisingly there's a bunch of bad wargear options in there:<br />
            <br />
            Pulse carbines on fire warriors are almost strictly worse than pulse rifles. Railguns on Hammerheads are
            strictly worse than ion cannons. Ion accelerator Riptides are not much better than heavy burst cannons, even
            against vehicles, but costs a lot more and isn't useful on smaller targets. There's virtually no reasons to
            take burst cannons (just take more fire warriors) or plasma rifles (just take ion blasters) on Crisis
            suits.
