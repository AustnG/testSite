                <h3 id="The Imperium of Man">The Imperium of Man</h3>
                <p>The Imperium of Man is a despotic human empire that spans most of the galaxy and has existed for over
                    10,000 years. The Imperium is mired in a prolonged dark age. Although it has access to technology
                    which is highly advanced by our present standards, scientific progress has ceased and its
                    technologies typically date back thousands of years. Imperial society is deeply religious and
                    superstitious, centered on the worship of the God Emperor of Mankind, the Imperium's founder and
                    nominal ruler. Those who do not worship the Emperor, including alien species and human followers of
                    Chaos, are mercilessly persecuted as heretics.</p>

                <p>Of all the factions, the Imperium has the largest catalog of models, which gives Imperial players
                    great flexibility in designing their army.</p>

                <h3 id="Chaos">Chaos</h3>
                <p>Within the parallel dimension known as the Warp dwell the Chaos Gods, who are monomaniacal and
                    depraved entities formed from the emotions and souls of mortals. The Chaos Gods have the ability to
                    twist the minds of mortals, amplifying certain emotional traits and inspiring reverence, like a
                    supernatural form of brainwashing. Worshippers of Chaos (most of whom depicted in the game are
                    human) tend to be insane, violent, and depraved, and they often exhibit grotesque physical mutations
                    such as extra mouths or limbs replaced with tentacles.</p>

                <p>Like the Imperium, the forces of Chaos have access to a large variety of models, meaning a Chaos army
                    can be designed for any style of play.</p>

                <h3 id="Eldar">Eldar</h3>
                <p>The Eldar are derived from the Elves of Warhammer Fantasy. They are an ancient species of aliens who
                    view humans and other non-Eldar species as vermin. In the distant past, they ruled an empire that
                    dominated the galaxy, but it was destroyed in a magical cataclysm, along with most of the
                    population. The surviving Eldar are divided into the ascetic inhabitants (known simply as "Eldar")
                    of the Craftworlds, massive spacecraft scattered across the galaxy, and the Dark Eldar, or Drukhari,
                    a race of sadistic space pirates who inhabit a massive port city hiddenwithin the Warp.</p>

                <p>Eldar infantry tend to be highly specialised and relatively frail "glass cannons." Because of their
                    lack of staying power, Eldar armies can suffer severe losses after a bad tactical decision or even
                    unlucky dice rolls, while successful gameplay can involve outnumbered Eldar units which outmaneuver
                    the opponent and killentire squads before they have a chance to retaliate.</p>

                <h3 id="Tyranids">Tyranids</h3>
                <p>The Tyranids are a mysterious alien race from beyond the Milky Way. They migrate from planet to
                    planet, devouring all life in their path. Tyranids are linked by a psychic hive mind; individual
                    Tyranids become feral when separated from it. Their "technology" is entirely biological: their ships
                    are living creatures, and their weapons are living components of their bodies.</p>

                <p>Tyranids have a preference for melee combat; their infantry units tend to be fast and hard-hitting
                    but frail. They also have low point values, meaning Tyranid armies in the game are typically fairly
                    large to compensate. Tyranids have the most powerful counter-measures against enemies with psychic
                    powers: many Tyranid units possess the "Shadow in the Warp" trait, which makes it harder for nearby
                    enemy psykers to use their psychic powers.[14]</p>

                <h3 id="Tau">Tau</h3>
                <p>The Tau, or T'au, are a race of blue-skinned aliens inhabiting a small but growing empire located
                    on the fringes of the Imperium of Man. The Tau Empire is the only faction in the setting that
                    actively integrates alien species into their society. They seek to subjugate all other races for the
                    benefit of all, under an ideology they call "the Greater Good." Some human worlds have willingly
                    defected from the Imperium to the Tau Empire. Although humans are effectively second-class citizens
                    in Tau society, they still tend to have a better quality of life than Imperium citizens. Despite
                    overall better living conditions, T'au life is typically heavily regimented and citizens experience
                    little or no freedom.</p>

                <p>Tau armies have a strong preference for ranged combat. The Tau do not have any psykers nor units that
                    specialise in countering psykers, which makes them somewhat more vulnerable to psychic attacks. Most
                    Tau vehicles are classified as flyers, skimmers, or jet pack infantry, meaning they can move swiftly
                    over difficult terrain.</p>

                <h3 id="Necrons">Necrons</h3>
                <p>The Necrons are an ancient race of skeleton-like robots. Millions of years ago, they were
                    flesh-and-blood beings, but suffered cancerous and short lives due to the natural proximity of their
                    homeworld to their star. In spite of this, they forged a galaxy spanning empire with advanced
                    technology and devastating weaponry. Seeking to extend their naturally short and painful lives, they
                    transferred their minds into robot bodies to achieve immortality. However, the transference process
                    was flawed, and all but most high-ranking Necrons became mindless automatons. They are waking up
                    from millions of years of hibernation in underground vaults, and seek to rebuild their old
                    empire.</p>

                <p>Necron infantry are characterised by strong ranged firepower, tough armor, and slow movement. They
                    are known primarily for their trademark "gauss flayer" weapons and reanimation abilities. As robots
                    made of quasi-living metal, many Necron units possess the ability to reassemble themselves after
                    being slain and fight on. As machines, Necrons possess maximum leadership across all units but are
                    also relatively slow moving outside of some transports. Necrons do not have any psykers, which makes
                    them vulnerable to psychic attacks.</p>

                <h3 id="Orks">Orks</h3>
                <p>The Orks are green-skinned aliens based on the traditional orcs of high fantasy fiction. Their
                    culture revolves around war for its own sake, periodically erupting into massive crusades against
                    Imperial planets or other species. Orks are a comical species, having crude personalities, wielding
                    ramshackle weaponry, and speaking with Cockney accents.</p>

                <p>In the tabletop game, Ork infantry units are typically slow-moving, tough, and numerous. They have a
                    preference for melee combat, as their ranged units are weak.</p>
